# prime-symbiote-agentic-tools

Monorepo for Prime's agentic tooling projects.

## Projects

Each project is preserved under `projects/<repo-name>/` with history imported via `git subtree`.

## Prime Forge vs Prime Core

- **Prime Forge** (this repo): public-facing tools, templates, and agentic OSS projects.
- **Prime Core**: private internal tooling, operations, memory sync internals, and sensitive workflows.

Do **not** commit private data or internal operational artifacts to Prime Forge.
