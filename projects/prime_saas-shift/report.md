## By Pricing Model

### Consumption (2)
- **Snowflake** (Analytics): Pure consumption model since inception. Credits-based. Well-positioned for agentic workloads.
- **Databricks** (Analytics): DBU-based pricing. Pure consumption. Agent-friendly by design.

### Hybrid (5)
- **Salesforce** (CRM): AELA launched: $0.10/action via Flex Credits. Agentforce handles 84% of interactions. Still has per-seat for core CRM.
- **Adobe** (Creative): Firefly generative credits alongside per-seat Creative Cloud. Transitioning but seat model still dominant.
- **Microsoft 365** (Productivity): Copilot at $30/user/month (seat-based AI add-on). Azure AI services are consumption. Dual model.
- **Notion** (Productivity): AI add-on with usage limits. Still primarily per-member pricing.
- **GitHub** (DevTools): Copilot consumption-based for enterprise. Actions already usage-based. Strong agentic positioning.

## Key Insights

1. **Hybrid is the transition state**: Most major SaaS companies are running dual models —
   maintaining per-seat for existing revenue while bolting on consumption/action pricing for AI.

2. **Data platforms lead**: Snowflake and Databricks were already consumption-based,
   making them naturally agent-friendly without pricing surgery.

3. **The $0.10 action**: Salesforce's Flex Credits at $0.10/action may become the
   de facto price anchor for agentic SaaS, similar to how AWS set cloud pricing norms.

4. **Creative tools lag**: Adobe, Canva, and Figma still rely heavily on per-seat models.
   Firefly credits are a start, but the transition will be slower for creative workflows
   that still require human judgment.

5. **The "seat" isn't dead yet**: Per-seat pricing persists where human users directly
   interact with the product. The shift is happening fastest in back-office automation
   where agents can fully replace human workflows.
